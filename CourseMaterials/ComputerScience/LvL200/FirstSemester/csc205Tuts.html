                 Introduction to Computer Science, currently know as CSC205 is a fundamental course taken in
                 the University of Buea. <br>
                 The course acts as a primary prerequisite to the myriads of courses offered by the department.

                 The <span>historical foundation of computing </span> goes a long way toward explaining
                why computing systems today are designed as they are. Think of this
                section as a story whose characters and events have led to the place we are
                now and form the foundation of the exciting future to come. We examine
                the history of computing hardware and software separately because they
                each have their own impact on how computing systems evolved into the
                layered model we use as the outline for this book.
                This history is written as a narrative, with no intent to formally define
                the concepts discussed. In subsequent chapters, we return to these concepts
                and explore them in more detail.

             <h5>A Brief History of Computing Hardware</h5>
             <p>
                 The devices that assist humans in various forms of computation have their
                 roots in the ancient past and have continued to evolve throughout the present
                 day. Let’s take a brief tour through the history of computing hardware. 
             </p><br>
             <h6>Early History</h6>
             <div id="earlyHistory"><p>
                 Many people believe that Stonehenge, the famous collection of rock
     monoliths in Great Britain, is an early form of calendar or astrological
     calculator. The abacus, which appeared in the sixteenth century, was
     developed as an instrument to record numeric values and on which a
     human can perform basic arithmetic.
     In the middle of the seventeenth century, Blaise Pascal, a French mathe-
     matician, built and sold gear-driven mechanical machines, which
     performed whole-number addition and subtraction. Later in the seven-
     teenth century, a German mathematician, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz,
     built the first mechanical device designed to do all four whole-number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Unfortu-
     nately, the state of mechanical gears and levers at that time was such that
     the Leibniz machine was not very reliable.
     In the late eighteenth century, Joseph Jacquard developed what became
     known as Jacquard’s Loom, used for weaving cloth. The loom used a
     series of cards with holes punched in them to specify the use of specific
     colored thread and therefore dictate the design that was woven into the
     cloth. Though not a computing device, Jacquard’s Loom was the first to
     make use of an important form of input: the punched card.
     It wasn’t until the nineteenth century that the next major step was
     taken, this time by a British mathematician. Charles Babbage designed
     what he called his analytical engine. His design was too complex for him
     to build with the technology of his day, so it was never implemented. His
     vision, however, included many of the important components of today’s
     computers. His design was the first to include a memory so that interme-
     diate values did not have to be re-entered. His design also included the
     input of both numbers and mechanical steps, making use of punched cards
     similar to those used in Jacquard’s Loom.
     Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, was a most romantic figure in the
     history of computing. Ada, the daughter of Lord Byron (the English poet),
     was a skilled mathematician. She became interested in Babbage’s work on
     the analytical engine and extended his ideas (as well as correcting some of
     his errors). Ada is credited with being the first programmer. The concept
     of the loop—a series of instructions that repeat—is attributed to her. The
     programming language Ada, used largely by the United States Department
     of Defense, is named for her.
     During the later part of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the
     twentieth century computing advances were made rapidly. William
     Burroughs produced and sold a mechanical adding machine. Dr. Herman Hollerith developed the first electro-mechanical tabulator.
